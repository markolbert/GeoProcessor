## Obtaining API Keys
The library relies on cloud-based services for snapping a track to 
roadways. Currently two are supported, **Bing Maps** and
the map/street functions in the **Google Cloud Platform**.

Both require you to sign up for a developer account in order to obtain
the API key `GeoProcessor` requires. Generally speaking, personal or
development-focused low-volume use doesn't cost anything. But once you
get beyond certain limits you will have to pay for the service.

You can sign up for **Bing Maps** at [their developer portal](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/).
Similarly, you can sign up for the **Google Cloud Platform** via their 
[developer's console](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj8neui_4_uAhWiL30KHeRLB4oQFjAAegQIBhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.developers.google.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw39ieEDI7pzBj4NtuzqS57M).
